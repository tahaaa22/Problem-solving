##Approach one
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where Salary <> (select  max(Salary) from Employee);


##Approach two (using IFNULL)
select IFNULL((Select distinct salary from Employee
 order by salary desc
 limit 1 offset 1), null) as SecondHighestSalary;

##Approach three (nested queries)
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee 
where Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee);

##Approach four using double select to handle null case
select (select distinct Salary from Employee
order by Salary desc
limit 1 offset 1
)as SecondHighestSalary;
